# GitSushi Restaurant

GitSushi is a team project developed as part of the Factoría F5 bootcamp. Its objective is to create a restaurant application using a decoupled architecture for the frontend and backend.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The application is divided into two separate repositories:

- **Frontend repository:** [GitSushi Restaurant Frontend](https://github.com/FactoriaF5-Asturias/project-p5-digital-academy-team1-restaurant-frontend)
- **Backend repository:** [GitSushi Restaurant Backend](https://github.com/FactoriaF5-Asturias/project-p5-digital-academy-team1-restaurant-backend)

## ✨ Features

### 👥 Customers
* **Order Placement:** Customers must be able to place their orders either on-site using available tablets or from home via the application.
* **Shopping Cart:** Selected products must be added to a temporary cart where users can add or remove items.
* **Quantity Selection:** When selecting a product, the customer must have the option to add more than one unit.
* **On-Site Payment:** For orders placed on-site via tablets, customers must be able to pay at the cashier counter or by credit/debit card.
* **Online Payment:** If the order is placed online (prior registration is required), customers must be able to pay by credit/debit card or choose cash on delivery.
* **Order Status:** Customers must have access to a section showing their real-time order status, which is managed by the kitchen.
* **Accounts & Offers:** Customers must be able to create an account to access exclusive offers.
* **Profile Details:** Registered customers are required to fill out a profile containing the following information: `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Address`, `Postal Code`, `City`, and `Email`.
* **Voice Input:** In the profile setup form, the `City` field must support voice-to-text input.
* **Order Tracking:** A tracking system must monitor deliveries.

### 🍳 Kitchen
* **Management Interface:** The kitchen staff must have access to a dedicated dashboard for order management and fulfillment.
* **Status Updates:** Kitchen staff must be able to update the order status to:
  - [ ] `In Progress`
  - [ ] `Delayed`
  - [ ] `Ready`

### 🛵 Delivery Drivers
* **Driver Interface:** Delivery drivers must have access to a mobile-friendly dashboard to update delivery statuses.
* **Status Tracking:** Drivers must be able to mark orders as:
  - [ ] `In Transit`
  - [ ] `Delivered`
* **Notifications:** Once an order is marked as `In Transit`, the customer must automatically receive a notification email.

### 💼 Administration
* **Admin Interface:** The administration team must have access to a comprehensive dashboard for managing the platform.
* **Product Management:** Full CRUD operations for products, including at least the following categories: *Drinks*, *Specialties*, and *Desserts*. This includes:
  - Adding new products to the menu.
  - Disabling products temporarily due to stock shortages.
  - Removing products from the menu entirely.
* **Invoicing:** Once a customer completes payment, the order status must be updated to `Paid`, and the transaction details must be logged in an invoicing table.
* **Sales Reports:** Administrators must have the ability to download sales summaries.
* **Analytics:** The admin dashboard must display the following sales data:
  - Daily sales totals
  - Monthly sales totals
  - Quarterly sales totals
  - Annual sales totals

### ⚙️ System
* **Automated Reports:** The system must automatically generate a sales summary report in **PDF format**.
* **Cloud Storage:** Generated summaries must be securely saved to a cloud object storage service (e.g., *Firebase*, *Supabase*).

## 📊 Project Planning and Management

This project is developed using **Agile methodologies** to ensure efficient delivery and high code quality across our decoupled repositories.

### 🔄 Agile Implementation
* **Product Backlog:** A clear, well-defined, and strictly prioritized backlog mapping out all system requirements (Customers, Kitchen, Drivers, Admin, and System Automation).
* **Sprint Organization:** Development is divided into two sprints.
  - **Jira** is used for sprint planning, user stories, task distribution, and progress tracking.

## 🛠️ Backend Best Practices
- **Data Validation:** Strict validation of all incoming request payloads.
- **Structured Responses:** Consistent and properly formatted HTTP response structures.
- **Middleware:** Middleware layers for security, logging, and request processing.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure authentication using robust token systems (e.g., JWT).
- **Well-Defined Routing:** Clear, intuitive, and RESTful API endpoints.
- **User Management System:** A complete system for managing user registration, roles, and profiles.
- **Password Hashing:** Secure password storage using advanced hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- **Architecture Patterns:** A clean architecture using controllers, services, and repositories.
- **File & Image Handling:** Efficient processing, upload management, and storage of media files.

## 🌿 Gitflow & Version Control
- **Proper Git Usage:** Strict adherence to clean version control practices.
- **Pull Requests:** Meaningful PRs with proper documentation, reviews, and descriptions.
- **Descriptive Commits:** Clear, semantic commit messages following best practices (e.g., Conventional Commits).
- **Branching Strategy:** Proper segregation of features, bug fixes, and hotfixes using dedicated branches.
- **Standardized Branches:** Use of consistent naming conventions for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `release/`).
- **Platform Management:** Efficient repository organization and team collaboration using **GitHub**.
